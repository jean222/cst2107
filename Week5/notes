React Router
     React router dom provides you with a hook 

useRoutes
    It is a regular function provided by this library => " import { useRoutes } from 'react-router-dom' "
    This function takes a parameter as an array of objects, where I provide the path where I want to go to, and what component should be loaded on that page.

    let element = useRoutes ([
        {
            path: '/',
            element: <HomePage />       // This will take you to the homepage
        },
        {
            path: '/',
            element: <CryptoDetailsPage />      // this will take you to the crypto details page
        },
        {
            path: '/',
            element: <NotFoundPage />       // This will take you to the not found page
        }
    ])

    return element;
